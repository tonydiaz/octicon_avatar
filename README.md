http://codepen.io/tonydiaz/pen/wMBZZW

This simple project will retrieve an octicon. In this case it is the `Octocat` and it will overlay it on the image provided. I could be your Github avatar of another one.

At the moment it is sized for your Github Avatar at 230px x 230px.

In the style.css file you can change the color and opacity of the octicon.
